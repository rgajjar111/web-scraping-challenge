# web-scraping-challenge
This project involves web scraping news articles from the Mars news website. It uses the Splinter and BeautifulSoup libraries to automate the process. The README provides an overview of the project.

Overview
Web scraping is a technique to extract data from websites. In this project, we scrape news articles from the Mars news website and tables. The process involves the following steps:

Visiting the Website: We use automated browsing to visit the Mars news site using chromedriver. This step requires identifying the elements to scrape, which can be done using browser developer tools.

Scraping the Website: A Beautiful Soup object is created to parse the HTML content of the website. We extract text elements, including article titles and previews.

Storing the Results: We organize the scraping results in a structured format. Each article's title and preview are stored in Python dictionaries, pandas dataframes, and csv file

Data Visualization: The project creates visualizations to represent the analyzed data. This includes generating bar charts and scatter plots to illustrate temperature trends and other findings.

Prerequisites
Before running the script, make sure you have the required libraries installed:

Splinter
Beautiful Soup (bs4)
Pandas
Matplotlib
